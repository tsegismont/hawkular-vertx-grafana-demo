= hawkular-vertx-grafana-demo

This project shows how to use Hawkular to:

- store a metric collected in a Vert.x application
- display the metric with Grafana or Hawkular Charts
- receive an alert when the metric exceeds a threshold

== Download Hawkular

This will download an all-in-one package (Metrics+Alerts+Cassandra), which is quite useful for development.

[source,bash]
----
curl http://download.jboss.org/hawkular/hawkular/1.0.0.Alpha11/hawkular-dist-1.0.0.Alpha11.tar.gz | tar xz
----

== Run

In the same directory as before:

[source,bash]
----
cd hawkular-1.0.0.Alpha11/bin
./standalone.sh
----

== Register a new user

Browse to http://localhost:8080 And click the 'Register' button.

In this demo we will use the 'admin' user with 'pa55,Word' password.
